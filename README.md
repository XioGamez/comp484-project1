Elements
- picture can be found in index.html
- embed can be found in index.html
- wbr wasn't able to use
  Purpose: tells browser where it's allowed to break a long word or URL if it doesn't fit. Doesn't force the break, but provides "hint" for line wrapping
  This prevents having to scroll horizontally or have overflow on small screens.
  It improves readability for long names, book titles, or URLs.
  Keeps layout neat.

  On any single page I didn't see the need to use it and didn't feel like throwing it in without purpose. There aren't and long words or URLs in my website that would need it. 

Attrabutes
- translate can be found in about.html and review.html
- pattern can be found in contact.html
- required can be found in contact.html
  
  Contact.html was created to be able to use 'pattern' and 'required' since that seems to be the only place they can be use. Since the context to my website is a book review type blog, it makes sense that there would be a page where people could send their thought.
