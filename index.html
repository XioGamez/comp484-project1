                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p><i>When my imagination isn't enough I use someone else's.</i></p>
                <p>I'm not really pick about the genre, but I draw the line at non-fiction. Why would I read about real life
                    (I can live it to a degree) when I can read about fairies and magic and adventure and romance that I'll
                    probably never experience.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>I've been reading a lot of romance (I know what a surprise) so it was a nice change of pace. Red Rising
                    still has some, but it's not what drives the plot forward. It was also nice to find that the hype of
                    this book was accurate. Literally, BookTok has been feeding people lie. That or they obviously have no
                    taste for good story telling and writing done well.</p>
                <p>The only good recs so far (in no particular order):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Will of The Many</li>
                    <li>The Fifth Season</li>
                    <li>Red Rising</li>
                    <li>Project Hail Mary</li>
                </ul>
