                <p><strong>SPOILERS</strong><br>I really like the plot, but it has some similarities to <i>The Hunger Games</i>. <span translate="no">Darrow</span> is at the bottom of this hierarchical society and is kind of thrown into this competition with the people at the very top, Golds. He has trials that he needs to overcome that are being streamed to their "mentors". I would say that his motivations are also similar to Katniss, in the way that they enter this "culling" to better their situations.</p>
                <p>I love that they character's moral accurately represent the world that they are in. It's refreshing to see that <span translate="no">Darrow</span> is willing to do whatever in order to achieve his goal. If you're in a war where is killed or be killed, don't contemplate if killing is wrong, JUST DO IT. People die in war, it's normal.</p>
                <p>Even though the story was enjoyable, I ended up reading the book in chunks. There were parts that were interesting that made me want to keep reading. Then it would be followed up with would put me in a reading slump. Like the pacing could have been better, but at least the slow sections weren't really long.Every time I would pick it back up, I found myself forgetting what character was which and their contribution to the story so far. (Description for basically every character: gold hair, "gold" skin, gold eyes, and bigger, taller, smarter than a normal person).</p>

                <p>Basically the same thing but with spaceships. <span translate="no">SEVRO</span> IS BEST BOY THOUGH.</p>
                <p>(I would have written more, but I don't really remember enough, just that it was better that the first).</p>

                <p><strong>SPOILERS</strong><br>This could have been a trilogy. As of right now, I have no desire to know what happens after that horrible ending. Up till that last maybe 2-3 pages, it was perfect. WHY?!!<br>If only she hadn't brought out that damn baby.</p>
